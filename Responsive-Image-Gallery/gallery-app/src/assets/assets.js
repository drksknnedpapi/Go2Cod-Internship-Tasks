    name: "The Scream",
    description:
      "The Scream is autobiographical, an expressionistic construction based on Munch's actual experience of a scream piercing through nature while on a walk, after his two companions, seen in the background, had left him. Fitting the fact that the sound must have been heard at a time when his mind was in an abnormal state, Munch renders it in a style which if pushed to extremes can destroy human integrity. As previously noted, the flowing curves of art nouveau represent a subjective linear fusion imposed upon nature, whereby the multiplicity of particulars is unified into a totality of organic suggestion with feminine overtones. But man is part of nature, and absorption into such a totality liquidates the individual. Beginning at this time Munch included art nouveau elements in many pictures but usually only in a limited or modified way. ",

    description: "The Portrait of Korney Chukovsky (1910) by Ilya Repin is a striking representation of the celebrated Russian writer, literary critic, and translator Korney Ivanovich Chukovsky. Painted during the twilight of Repin's career, this portrait showcases his mastery of realism and psychological depth.In the artwork, Chukovsky is depicted seated, his posture relaxed yet contemplative, with an intense gaze that conveys his intellectual vigor and critical mind. The color palette is subdued, dominated by earthy tones, with careful attention to the textures of his clothing and facial features, emphasizing his character and personality. Repin captures not just the physical likeness of Chukovsky but also his essence as a thinker and cultural figure.",

    name: "La persistencia de la memoria (The Persistence of Memory)",
    description: "La persistencia de la memoria (The Persistence of Memory, 1931) by Salvador Dalí is one of the most iconic and enigmatic works of Surrealist art. This small yet powerful painting depicts a dreamlike landscape where time seems to dissolve and reality is questioned. The scene is dominated by soft, melting clocks draped over various objects, defying the rigid structure and permanence usually associated with time. Set against a desolate background of rocky cliffs and a calm sea, the painting evokes an eerie, almost otherworldly stillness. A mysterious, amorphous figure resembling a distorted human face—believed to be a self-representation of Dalí—rests in the center, partially covered by a melting clock. Ants swarm over a golden timepiece in the foreground, suggesting decay and the impermanence of life. ",

    name: "The Baptism of Christ",
    description: "The John the Baptist series was probably painted c. 1655 for the monastery of San Leandro in Murillo's home town of Seville (where it remained until 1812), and it marks an important step in the development of Murillo's mature style. 'The Baptism of Christ' already demonstrates mastery of brushwork, reticent colouring and delicately blurred faces, but the forms are not yet so delicately linked together, and the astringent, profoundly serious atmosphere has none of the sweetness of many of his later works, of which the Berlin gallery owned two significant examples until 1945. Murillo clearly surpasses an altar-panel painted by Rubens in Mechelen, which is known to us from drawings and to which Murillo's composition owes a great deal, particularly in the naturalness of the pictorial structure with the two life-size figures.",

    description: "The Adoration of the Magi by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo is a luminous and heartfelt depiction of the biblical scene where the three Wise Men present their gifts to the Christ Child. Painted in the late 17th century, this masterpiece reflects Murillo’s signature style, characterized by warmth, naturalism, and tender emotion, which made him one of the most celebrated Baroque painters in Spain. In the composition, the Virgin Mary sits at the center, gently cradling the Christ Child, who looks toward the Wise Men with curiosity and innocence. The three Magi, dressed in ornate and colorful robes, kneel before the infant Jesus, offering their gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh with reverence and awe.",

    description: "The School of Athens (1510–1511) by Raphael is one of the most celebrated masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance and a defining example of High Renaissance art. Painted as a fresco on the walls of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican, it is part of a series of works in the Stanza della Segnatura, where Raphael explored themes of philosophy, theology, poetry, and law. This particular fresco represents philosophy and celebrates the intellectual achievements of antiquity. The scene depicts an idealized gathering of ancient Greek philosophers, scientists, and thinkers, brought together in a grand architectural setting that reflects classical ideals of harmony and balance. At the center stand Plato and Aristotle, two of the most influential philosophers in history. Plato, holding his book Timaeus and pointing upward, symbolizes the realm of ideal forms and metaphysical truth. Aristotle, holding his Nicomachean Ethics and gesturing horizontally, emphasizes empirical observation and practical knowledge.",

    description: "La Dolorosa (The Sorrowful Virgin) by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo is a deeply moving depiction of the Virgin Mary, capturing her in a moment of profound grief. Painted in the 17th century, this work embodies the Baroque era's focus on emotional intensity and religious devotion. The Virgin Mary is portrayed with her hands clasped in prayer, her gaze turned upward as though seeking divine solace. Her expression is one of quiet anguish, reflecting her sorrow as the mother of Christ during his Passion. Murillo's soft, luminous brushwork emphasizes her ethereal beauty, with delicate details in her features and flowing garments. The muted color palette, dominated by blues and whites, reinforces her purity and heavenly nature, while the warm light highlights her emotional depth. ",

    name: "The Creation of Adam",
    description: "Of all the marvelous images that crowd the immense complex of the Sistine Ceiling, The Creation of Adam is undoubtedly the one which has most deeply impressed posterity. No wonder, for here we are given a single overwhelming vision of the sublimity of God and the potential nobility of man unprecedented and unrivaled in the entire history of visual art. No longer standing upon earth with closed eyes and mantle, the Lord floats through the heavens, His mantle widespread and bursting with angelic forms, and His calm gaze accompanying and reinforcing the movement of His mighty arm. He extends His forefinger, about to touch that of Adam, who reclines on the barren coast of earth, barely able as yet to lift his hand. The divine form is convex, explosive, paternal; the human concave, receptive, and conspicuously impotent. The incipient, fecundating contact about to take place between the two index fingers has often been described as a spark or a current, a modern electrical metaphor doubtless foreign to the sixteenth century, but natural enough considering the river of life which seems about to flow into the waiting body.",

His mane of hair snaps in the wind, and brows curl over red-rimmed eyes and a tear of anger. His body is perfect. His posture appears reposed, but each muscle is flexed with potential energy. Cast from heaven—this is the moment before he rises again.",

Tronies depict a certain type or character; in this case a girl in exotic dress, wearing an oriental turban and an improbably large pearl in her ear. Johannes Vermeer was the master of light. This is shown here in the softness of the girl’s face and the glimmers of light on her moist lips. And of course, the shining pearl.",

Painted between 1503 and 1519, it was owned by French royalty for centuries. Liberated by Revolutionary forces, the painting briefly adorned Napoleon’s bedroom, then was installed in the Louvre. Over 80% of Louvre visitors come specifically to see Mona Lisa. Due to new queuing practices, visitors have only 30 seconds to admire the painting’s legendary mystique. Thought by most scholars to be a portrait of Italian noble Lisa del Giocondo, this beautiful, dark-haired woman with an enigmatic gaze has fascinated people for ages. Unlike most 16th-century portraits of nobility, which showed off their social status and wealth with flamboyant clothing, hairstyles and accessories, Mona Lisa is dressed in elegant simplicity, which draws attention to her face.",

Almost everything else we know about his appearance comes from the many self-portraits he painted. No fewer than 35 of them are known. They tell us that he had red hair, green eyes and an angular face. Yet each of those faces is different. Vincent himself wrote: ‘People say – and I’m quite willing to believe it – that it’s difficult to know oneself – but it’s not easy to paint oneself either.’",

Inspired by the view from his window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy, in southern France, where the artist spent twelve months in 1889–90 seeking reprieve from his mental illnesses, The Starry Night (made in mid-June) is both an exercise in observation and a clear departure from it.",
